            WELCOME
        </h1>
        <p>
            This is the Information Technology age and at its core
             is Computer Science. The study of computer science
             is therefore critical if society is to take full
             advantage of the benefits Information Technology has to
             offer and make rapid economic advances. Computer science
             involves the study and development of applications that 
             allow for our everyday use of computers, the software systems
             that support these applications, and the means and methods
             used to produce both applications and systems that behave
             reliably, correctly and ethically. At the heart of Computer Science
             lies the skill of computer programming and employers who hire 
             Computer Scientists expect adept programmers with knowledge of
              current techniques and tools and the ability to apply sound 
              engineering principles to the development, construction and 
              maintenance of computer programs.
        </p>

             The range of courses available in the department and the skills
             acquired by students enable them to find employment in many 
             diverse fields of the economy and prepare our graduates for the
             computing industry, working in a project team (or research and
             development team), and to enable the graduate to bring specialist
             skills to that team. The course also provides the platform for 
             further study or research through exposure to established and 
             emerging technologies and methods, and to active fields of 
             research in Computer Science.
        </p>

             The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor 
             of Science in Computer Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor
              (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.

                The University of Ghana is one of the Africa's most preeminent 
                public universities. Our impact on individuals, our region 
                and the world is profound. whether we are launching young 
                people into a boundless future or confronting the grand 
                challenges of our time through dauntless research. UG educates 
                more than 38,000 students annually, with approximately 2.64% 
                being computer science students. We turn ideas into impact and 
                transform the world around us. For more about our impact, visit
