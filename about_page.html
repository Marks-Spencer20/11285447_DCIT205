            WELCOME
        </h1>
        <p>
            This is the Information Technology age and at its core
             is Computer Science. The study of computer science
             is therefore critical if society is to take full
             advantage of the benefits Information Technology has to
             offer and make rapid economic advances. Computer science
             involves the study and development of applications that 
             allow for our everyday use of computers, the software systems
             that support these applications, and the means and methods
             used to produce both applications and systems that behave
             reliably, correctly and ethically. At the heart of Computer Science
             lies the skill of computer programming and employers who hire 
             Computer Scientists expect adept programmers with knowledge of
              current techniques and tools and the ability to apply sound 
              engineering principles to the development, construction and 
              maintenance of computer programs.
        </p>
        <p>
             The range of courses available in the department and the skills
             acquired by students enable them to find employment in many 
             diverse fields of the economy and prepare our graduates for the
             computing industry, working in a project team (or research and
             development team), and to enable the graduate to bring specialist
             skills to that team. The course also provides the platform for 
             further study or research through exposure to established and 
             emerging technologies and methods, and to active fields of 
             research in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
             The Department offers two undergraduate degree programmes, Bachelor 
             of Science in Computer Science Single-Major (3:2:1:1) and Major-Minor
              (3:2:2:1) as well as Bachelor of Science in Information Technology.

                So what defines our students, faculty and community members? 
                Above all, it’s our belief in the infinite possibilitie and our 
                unshakable optimism. It’s a connection to others near and far. 
                A hunger for socio-economic transformation that pushes us to 
                tackle challenges and pursue progress. It’s the conviction that 
                together we can create a world of good. Join us on the journey.
